* Open Source code
    - lib S52
    - lib S52 deps
    - specs
        + S52 / S57
        + OpenGL
        + GIS (WKT format)
        + projection (WGS84)
        + color (CEIxyL -> RGB)

* Platform Neutral (GTK+ framework)
    - Linux (Unix)
    - OSX   (Unix)
    - Win32 (Windows)

* Architecture Neutral
    - X86    32 bits (Linux, Win32, OSX)
    - X86_64 64 bits (Linux)
    - ARM            (Linux, OSX)

* Open Cross-Compiling Developpement Framework
    - use Open Source dev tool
	- create binairies on one platform targetted for an other platfrom
    - allow interpreted language to drive the lib (ex: Ruby for driving libS52.dll and the UI)

* OpenGL
    - V1.4 (VBO - Vertex Buffer Object live on GPU)
    - hardware accelerated graphic (GPU)
        * super fast chart rendering (<10 ms)
        * hence quick feedback to the Mariner/User
        * free up CPU because GPU does all the work
    - ES SC - Embeded System Safety Critical (need work for 64 -> 32 geo convertion)
        * minimal OpenGL
        * minimal color handling
        * use for avionic, medical, military, automotive app (but not marine!)
        * serve as a guideline for what rendering capability is essential and what is not
    - EGL / GLES2
        * OpenGL for Embeded System V2.0 (Android)
        * EGL is an interface to OpenGL ES and the underlying native platform windowing system.

* Workbench / Experimenting
    - depth / height adjustement
    - cursor pick via GPU (possible to handle alarm the same way)
    - centroid of clipped concave poly
    - hardware accelerated anti-aliase (OpenGL)
        * cleaner symbol
        * cleaner overall look
    - hardware accelereted (OpenGL) anti-aliase international (UTF-8) font rendering
    - provide a route to brige evolving tech. best practice to navigation
        * pick best and proven shore solution
        * academic atmosphere to innovation (rather then economic - profit drivent)
        * sharing of knowledge  (cross-polenisation of ideas)
        * open the silo mentality
        * governed by interroperability of open standard
        * ...
